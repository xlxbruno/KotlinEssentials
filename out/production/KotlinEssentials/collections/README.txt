Collections in Kotlin

1. A way to store and manipulate group of objects of data

Types of Collections

1. Immutable : collection is only readable : read-only format , elements cannot be modified
  - List - listOf() and listOf<T>() : T represents the data type
  - set - setOf()
  - map  - mapOf()
2. Mutable  : collection can be read and written : allows read and write functionalities
  - list - mutableListOf() , arrayListOf() and ArrayList
  - set - mutableSetOf() , hashSetOf()
  - map - mutableMapOf() , hashMapOf and HashMap


Advantages :
1. Improved code readability
2. Better memory management
3. Increased Efficiency
4. Increased type safety : only elements of the correct type are added to a collection

Disadvantages :
1. Perfomance overhead :
2. Complexity
